Lack of namespaces
==================

* Common prefix for identifiers to prevent conflicts:

  * glib: ``g_``
  * Gtk: ``gtk_``
  * Python: ``Py_``, ``_Py_`` ("private") or ``PY_`` (define)

* ``static`` keyword

  * function only accessible from the current file, not exported
  * variable only accessible from the current file, not exported
  * variable local to a function

* ``#include``: C preprocessor

Python has the ``make smelly`` tool to detect exported symbols which doesn't
start with ``Py_`` nor ``_Py_``.


Issues with types
=================

* comparison between signed and unsigned: who wins? cast signed to unsigned,
  or cast unsigned to signed? => obvious integer overflow
* integer overflow: undefined behaviour, the compiler is free to optimize.
  Check if an operation will overflow is hard, **especially** for signed
  numbers. GCC added builtin functions to check that in a portable and
  efficient way.
* portability: int==long==void*, no warning. if int and long have the same
  size, downcasting a long into an int is allowed, and don't emit any warning.
* int stored in void*
* void* vs intptr_t vs uintptr_t
* Use "int" to access an item of an array in a loop: the compiler may
  have to handle integer overflow. size_t or ssize_t preferred here?


Portability
===========

* Perl still uses C89
* Python only started to move to C99 with Python 3.6, only CPython is
  restricted to a **subset** of C99, the most portable parts of C99...
* GNU extensions of GCC
* glibc vs all other C libraries (ex: musl libc and uclibc). GNU extensions,
  again. Implementation bugs. Errno is sometimes set to 0 on success, sometimes
  it is not set on failure, it depends on the called function and the libc.
* ``<stdint.h>`` not fully supported in 2017, need some hacks to support old C
  compilers
* ``<stdatomic.h>`` is still "new" and not well supported by C compilers
* ``<stdbool.h>``?


Issues with C++
===============

* C code used in C++ has to be careful with exceptions: need to compile C with
  ``-fexceptions``?
* ``extern {`` trickery for header files

  (Thiago Macieira, June 2011)
* Python 2 slower: the C code base doesn't respect strict aliasing and so must
  be compiled with ``-fno-strict-aliasing`` (to avoid bugs when the compiler
  optimizes the code) which is inefficient. The structure of Python C type has
  been deeply rewritten to fix the root cause.

Change which fixed a crash after the merged of the new dict implementation
on a specific platform (don't recall which one!):
https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/186122ead26f3ae4c2bc9f6715d2a29d339fdc5a

Example::

    #include <stdint.h>
    #include <stdio.h>

    uint32_t
    swap_words( uint32_t arg )
    {
      uint16_t* const volatile sp = (uint16_t*)&arg;
      uint16_t        hi = sp[0];
      uint16_t        lo = sp[1];

      sp[1] = hi;
      sp[0] = lo;

      return (arg);
    }

    int main(void)
    {
        uint32_t x = 0xabcd1234;
        uint32_t y = swap_words(x);
        printf("x=%lx\n", (long unsigned int)x);
        printf("y=%lx\n", (long unsigned int)y);
        return 0;
    }

Bug::

    $ LANG= gcc -O3 x.c -o x -fstrict-aliasing -Wstrict-aliasing=2 && ./x
    x.c: In function 'swap_words':
    x.c:7:3: warning: dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict-aliasing rules [-Wstrict-aliasing]
       uint16_t* const volatile sp = (uint16_t*)&arg;
       ^~~~~~~~
    x=abcd1234
    y=abcd1234


GCC warnings
============

* ``-Wall``: some warnings
* ``-Wall -Wextra``: more warnings
* ``-Wall -Wextra -O3``: even more warnings. Some warnings are only emitted
  when the compiler optimizes the code, like dead code or unused variables.
* There are even more. GCC is able to emit even more warnings, but they must
  be enabled explictly!

  * ``-fstrict-aliasing -Wstrict-aliasing=2``


Platforms #define
=================

* AIX: ``#ifdef _AIX``
* FreeBSD: ``#ifdef __FreeBSD__``
* Linux: ``#ifdef __linux__``
* NetBSD: ``#ifdef __NetBSD__``
* Solaris: ``#ifdef sun``
* Windows: ``_WIN32`` or ``_WIN64``
* macOS: ``#ifdef __APPLE__``


Compiler defines
================

* `GCC <https://gcc.gnu.org/>`_:
  ``#if defined(__GNUC__) && ((__GNUC__ > 4) || ((__GNUC__ == 4) && (__GNUC_MINOR__ > 5)))``
* `Clang <https://clang.llvm.org/>`_:
  ``#ifdef __clang__``
* :ref:`Visual Studio <visual-studio>`:
  ``#if defined(_MSC_VER) && _MSC_VER >= 1800``
